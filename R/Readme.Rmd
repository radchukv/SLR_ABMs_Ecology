## Systematic literature review of systematic literature reviews of ABMs in ecology

This project analyses the data of systematic literature review conducted to describe the current status of systematic literature reviews on ABMs in the field of ecology. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
